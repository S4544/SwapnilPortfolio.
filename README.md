# Swapnil Portfolio

This repository contains my personal portfolio website and a dedicated GitHub-focused page.

## Live Website

- **Main Portfolio:** [https://S4544.github.io/SwapnilPortfolio/](https://S4544.github.io/SwapnilPortfolio/)
- **GitHub-Only Page:** [https://S4544.github.io/SwapnilPortfolio/github.html](https://S4544.github.io/SwapnilPortfolio/github.html)

## How to Host on GitHub Pages

1. Upload these files to your GitHub repository.
2. Go to **Settings → Pages** and set the source to the `main` branch and `/root` folder.
3. After a minute, your website will be live at the GitHub Pages link.

## Contents

- `index.html` → Main Portfolio Website
- `github.html` → GitHub-Only Focused Page
- `css/` → Stylesheets
- `img/` → Images (profile photo, etc.)
- `assets/` → Additional JS or assets
